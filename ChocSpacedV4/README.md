**PLEASE NOTE**
07/19/24 This is a work in progress. The files are all here, but I could probably organize them a little better and give a bit of a walk through. Please be patient while I sort this out.

i believe the BOM and Position files at this time do not include the hot swap sockets, so this would need to be soldered separately. I hope to update that in the future. 

All case files are located in the zip file, but if you just want to dowload specific options, feel free. These only fit the board I have designed.
